# NFiniT - Never Forgotten Token

üöÄ **[Live Demo](https://never-forgetten-tokens.lovable.app/)** | Experience NFiniT in action

**We Die Twice: Once When We Perish, Again When Forgotten**

A blockchain-powered memorial platform that preserves the memories and legacy of loved ones as permanent NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain.

## üåü Inspiration

The inspiration for NFiniT comes from the profound human truth captured in our tagline: "We Die Twice: Once When We Perish, Again When Forgotten." In an increasingly digital world, family histories, traditions, and the stories of our loved ones are at risk of being lost forever. NFiniT was born from the desire to use cutting-edge blockchain technology to ensure that the memories, wisdom, and legacy of those we've lost are preserved permanently and authentically for future generations. We wanted to solve the problem of impermanent digital storage and provide families with a trustworthy, verified way to immortalize their loved ones.

## üí° What it does

NFiniT is a comprehensive blockchain-powered memorial platform that allows users to create, verify, and trade permanent digital memorials as NFTs. The platform features:

### Document Verification System
Users upload official documents (death certificates, obituaries, photos) which are processed using AI (Gemini API) to extract and verify key information about the deceased

### Memorial Creation Flow
A guided 3-step process where users upload documents, review extracted data, and build beautiful memorial NFTs with customizable templates

### Blockchain Minting
Verified memorials are minted as NFTs on the Ethereum Sepolia testnet with metadata stored permanently on IPFS

### Memorial Marketplace
A decentralized marketplace where memorial NFTs can be bought and sold, allowing for the preservation and transfer of family history

### Gallery System
Public gallery displaying all verified memorials, creating a searchable archive of human stories

### Wallet Integration
MetaMask integration with mock wallet balances for seamless blockchain interactions

### User Authentication
Secure user accounts with Supabase authentication and personalized memorial management

## üõ†Ô∏è How we built it

NFiniT was built using a modern full-stack architecture:

### Frontend:
- React 18 with TypeScript for type safety and modern development
- Vite for lightning-fast development and building
- Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI for beautiful, responsive design
- React Router for seamless navigation
- Ethers.js for blockchain integration and MetaMask connectivity

### Backend & Database:
- Supabase for authentication, real-time database, and file storage
- PostgreSQL with Row-Level Security (RLS) for secure data access
- Edge functions for document processing, NFT minting, and marketplace transactions

### AI & Document Processing:
- Google Gemini API for intelligent document analysis and data extraction
- OCR capabilities for processing death certificates and official documents
- Automated verification system that structures extracted information

### Blockchain Infrastructure:
- Ethereum Sepolia testnet for NFT minting and marketplace operations
- IPFS integration via Pinata for decentralized metadata storage
- Smart contract simulation for marketplace functionality
- Mock transaction system for demonstration purposes

### Key Features:
- Comprehensive database schema with memorials, ownership tracking, and transaction history
- File upload system supporting PDFs and images with AI processing
- Real-time marketplace with ownership verification
- Wallet balance management and transaction processing

## üöß Challenges we ran into

**Document Processing Complexity**: Extracting accurate information from various document formats (PDFs, images) proved challenging. We had to implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms when AI extraction failed.

**Blockchain Integration**: Integrating real blockchain functionality while maintaining a smooth user experience required careful balance between mock transactions for demo purposes and actual smart contract interactions.

**Data Consistency**: Ensuring that ownership transfers, marketplace listings, and wallet balances remained consistent across all transactions required implementing complex database relationships and careful transaction management.

**File Upload & Storage**: Managing large file uploads, conversion to base64 for AI processing, and efficient storage in Supabase required optimization to prevent timeouts and memory issues.

**User Experience Flow**: Creating an intuitive 3-step memorial creation process that guides users through document upload, verification, and memorial building while handling edge cases and errors gracefully.

**Security Considerations**: Implementing proper authentication, Row-Level Security policies, and preventing users from purchasing their own NFTs required careful security planning.

## üèÜ Accomplishments that we're proud of

**Complete End-to-End Platform**: Successfully built a fully functional memorial platform from document upload to NFT marketplace, with every component working seamlessly together.

**AI-Powered Document Verification**: Implemented sophisticated document processing that can extract structured data from various document types, providing authentic verification of memorial information.

**Elegant User Experience**: Created a beautiful, compassionate interface that guides users through the sensitive process of creating memorials with care and dignity.

**Robust Database Architecture**: Designed a comprehensive database schema that tracks ownership history, transactions, and marketplace activities with full audit trails.

**Blockchain Integration**: Successfully integrated Ethereum blockchain functionality with wallet connections, NFT minting, and marketplace operations.

**Real-time Marketplace**: Built a dynamic marketplace where users can list, browse, and purchase memorial NFTs with real-time updates and ownership verification.

**Permanent Storage Solution**: Implemented IPFS integration ensuring that memorial data is stored permanently and cannot be lost or corrupted.

## üìö What we learned

**AI Integration**: Learned how to effectively use Google Gemini API for document processing and structured data extraction, including handling various file formats and error cases.

**Blockchain Development**: Gained deep understanding of NFT development, marketplace creation, and the complexities of integrating blockchain technology with traditional web applications.

**Supabase Mastery**: Mastered advanced Supabase features including Edge Functions, Row-Level Security, file storage, and real-time database operations.

**User-Centered Design**: Learned the importance of designing sensitive applications with empathy, creating interfaces that are both functional and respectful of users' emotional needs.

**Full-Stack Architecture**: Developed expertise in building complex full-stack applications with proper separation of concerns, security considerations, and scalable database design.

**Error Handling & Resilience**: Learned to build robust systems that gracefully handle failures, from AI processing errors to blockchain transaction failures.

## üöÄ What's next for NFiniT

**Smart Contract Deployment**: Deploy actual smart contracts to Ethereum mainnet for real NFT minting and marketplace functionality, moving beyond the current simulation.

**Enhanced AI Features**: Implement more sophisticated AI capabilities including automatic obituary generation, memorial story creation, and advanced document authentication.

**Multi-Chain Support**: Expand beyond Ethereum to support other blockchains like Polygon, Solana, and layer-2 solutions for lower transaction costs.

**Family Tree Integration**: Build genealogy features that connect related memorials and create comprehensive family history networks.

**Mobile Application**: Develop native mobile apps for iOS and Android to make memorial creation more accessible.

**Advanced Memorial Templates**: Create more sophisticated memorial designs, interactive elements, and multimedia support including audio recordings and video tributes.

**Community Features**: Add social features like memorial visiting, digital flower leaving, and community storytelling.

**Enterprise Solutions**: Develop partnerships with funeral homes, cemeteries, and genealogy services to offer NFiniT as a service.

**Global Expansion**: Support for multiple languages and integration with international document standards for worldwide accessibility.

**Legacy Preservation Tools**: Build additional tools for digitizing physical photos, documents, and artifacts to create comprehensive digital estates.
